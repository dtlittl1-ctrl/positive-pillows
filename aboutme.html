    <h2 class="about-title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="about-intro">
      Positive Pillows is all about sharing comfort, encouragement, and love through handmade pillows
      that celebrate faith, family, and life’s special moments.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-subtitle">My Story</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a faith-filled, optimistic mom, grandmother, and maker who loves encouraging others.
      Inspired by my late mother, who taught me to sew, and my late husband, whose service and
      passion for coaching youth shaped my journey, I create pillows stitched with love.
      Each piece celebrates faith, family, and the power of lifting others up.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-subtitle">What You’ll Find in Every Pillow</h3>
    <p>
      Every Positive Pillow is designed to feel personal and meaningful, whether it’s a gift for
      a celebration, a “thinking of you” moment, or a quiet reminder of hope at home.
    </p>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li><strong>Faith:</strong> Gentle reminders of hope, peace, and God’s presence in everyday life.</li>
      <li><strong>Family:</strong> Designs inspired by loved ones, traditions, and the people who shaped this journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Encouragement:</strong> Words and themes meant to lift spirits and make someone feel seen and supported.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="about-subtitle">Pillows Stitched With Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      These pillows are more than decorations—they’re little messages of love. My goal is that each pillow
      you give or receive feels like a hug, a prayer, or a word of encouragement you can hold onto. Whether
      it’s for a new baby, a graduate, a coach, or someone who just needs a reminder that they are loved,
      I want every Positive Pillow to speak life into their story.
    </p>

    <p class="about-closing">
      Thank you for supporting a family-rooted, faith-driven craft that exists to uplift others—one pillow at a time.
